# Vrinda-Super-Store-Data-Analysis-Using-Excel
"Vrinda Super Store Data Analysis Using Excel" is a project in which I created a dynamic dashboard and extracted useful information from the store's data. I've attached a separate Excel file with detailed insights as well as a screenshot of the dashboard to demonstrate the visual representation of key metrics and trends. This project demonstrates my expertise in Excel, data analysis, and visualisation, while also providing actionable information to help Vrinda Super Store optimise operations.
